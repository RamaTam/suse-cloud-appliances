SUSE Cloud 4 Admin appliances
================================

Coming Soon...

This repo contains the source and documentation used to build the 
SUSE Cloud Admin Node appliances.

The appliances are intended to make testing / evaluation /
demonstration of SUSE Cloud as quick and easy as possible.
There are two appliances:

* [*standard*]() - 
  contains the SLES11 SP3 and SUSE Cloud 3 ISOs
* [*embedded*]() - 
  as standard, but also contains an image of all package updates.

Both are pre-configured with default settings appropriate for
deploying SUSE Cloud.

The appliances are built in [SUSE Studio](https://susestudio.com),
but can also be built locally via [`kiwi`](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI).
