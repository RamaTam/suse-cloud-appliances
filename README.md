SUSE OpenStack Cloud 5 Admin appliance
======================================
This repo contains the source and documentation used to build the 
SUSE OpenStack Cloud 5 Admin appliance.

The appliance is intended to make testing / evaluation /
demonstration of SUSE OpenStack Cloud as quick and easy as possible. It has also
been used for production deployments as well.

The appliance is pre-configured with default settings appropriate for
deploying SUSE OpenStack Cloud, which are contained in the official deployment guide.

The appliance is built in [SUSE Studio](https://susestudio.com),
but can also be built locally via [`kiwi`](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI).
